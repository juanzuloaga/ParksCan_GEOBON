We summarized a preliminary review of frameworks that have been proposed to protect biodiversity, manage ecosystem services, and inform decision makers and global, national and regional policy to address biodiversity loss and the erosion of ecosystem services.

Broadly speaking, these frameworks can be group into three groups:

-   Ecosystem services

-   Biodiversity

-   Traditional food security

-   Dual/multiple frameworks

We also show the elements of the GEO BON framework (essential variables and indicators) to measure, assess and monitor biodiversity and ecosystem services.
