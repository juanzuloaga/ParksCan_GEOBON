Globally, a key source of food providing high quality protein and supporting healthy diets is fish ([Béné et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305750X15002892?via%3Dihub)). Subsistence fisheries are meant to provide enough food for the fisher and their family/community. These small- scale fisheries are essential to food security for many communities but also support the culture and sense of place of many indigenous peoples ([McClanahan, Allison and Cinner, 2015](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/faf.12045)). Typically, subsistence fisheries are more sustainable than large-scale commercial fishing but can be heavily impacted by these practices as they rely on the same stocks of fish ([Béné et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305750X15002892?via%3Dihub)). As such, many communities around the world are facing reduced catch as a consequence of declining stocks, threatening their food security and culture ([Pauly, Watson and Alder, 2005](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2004.1574)).

## Fishers' Indigenous and local knowledge (ILK) has multidimensional contributions, worldwide

***Where:***

Wordlwide

***Description:***

Evaluate the contribution of fisher's indigenous and local knowledge.

156 cases based on 179 published studies on fishers' knowledge of aquatic ecosystems worldwide (between 1974 an 2022), including several organisms (fish, turtles, etc) and multiple research topics (e.g., population biology, invasive species, modeling, etc). ([Silvano et al 2023](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534722002518)).

***Goals/targets (biodiversity conservation/human well-being):***

[United Nations Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals)

***Limitations:***

***Strengths:***

Fishers' Indigenous and local knowledge can **broaden the available biodiversity/environmental indicators from conventional science** to evaluate changes, Some of the examples they include are:

-   shifts in behavior

-   fish condition ('skinny fish')

-   weather patterns

-   water color

-   presence of associated species

-   sea-water salinity

***Actions taken or suggested:***

Integrate fisher's indigenous and local knowledge into formalized management and conservation programs

Overcome intellectual inertia and structural features of research funding, bureaucracies and management institutions.

Operationalize the interface between conventional science and ILK by participatory monitoring, citizen science, community science and knowledge co-production.

Address limitations in conventional knowledge and ILK

## The Māori, the indigenous people of New Zealand

***Where:***

New Zealand

***Description:***

Traditional food practices were replaced following colonization as access to traditional foods decreased and have been largely replaced by the international food system ([McKerchar et al., 2015](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1757975914543573)).

***Goals/targets (biodiversity conservation/human well-being):***

***Limitations:***

***Strengths:***

***Actions taken or suggested:***

\- Increase the availability of traditional foods in households by replenishing fish stocks and communal gardening projects.

\- Legal recognition of Māori rights to manage freshwater habitats

\- Develop traditional food-based industries to generate income through employment opportunities.

***Impacts/results (potential and/or measured):***
