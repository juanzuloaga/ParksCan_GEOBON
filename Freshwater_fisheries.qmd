Globally, a key source of food providing high quality protein and supporting healthy diets is fish ([Béné et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305750X15002892?via%3Dihub)). Subsistence fisheries are meant to provide enough food for the fisher and their family/community. These small- scale fisheries are essential to food security for many communities but also support the culture and sense of place of many indigenous peoples ([McClanahan, Allison and Cinner, 2015](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/faf.12045)). Typically, subsistence fisheries are more sustainable than large-scale commercial fishing but can be heavily impacted by these practices as they rely on the same stocks of fish ([Béné et al., 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305750X15002892?via%3Dihub)). As such, many communities around the world are facing reduced catch as a consequence of declining stocks, threatening their food security and culture ([Pauly, Watson and Alder, 2005](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2004.1574)).

## The Māori, the indigenous people of New Zealand

***Where:***

New Zealand

***Description:***

Traditional food practices were replaced following colonization as access to traditional foods decreased and have been largely replaced by the international food system ([McKerchar et al., 2015](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1757975914543573)).

***Goals/targets (biodiversity conservation/human well-being):***

***Limitations:***

***Strengths:***

***Actions taken or suggested:***

\- Increase the availability of traditional foods in households by replenishing fish stocks and communal gardening projects.

\- Legal recognition of Māori rights to manage freshwater habitats

\- Develop traditional food-based industries to generate income through employment opportunities.

***Impacts/results (potential and/or measured):***
