Identifying priority areas for biodiversity and how conservation goals might be achieve efficiently conservation is part of the systematic conservation planning framework and requires among others, spatial proritization tools ([Moilanen et al 2022](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.13819#:~:text=Spatial%20(conservation)%20prioritization%20integrates%20data,impact%20avoidance%20outside%20protected%20areas.), [Kukkala and Moilanen 2012](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/brv.12008)).

## Mapping co-benefits for carbon storage and biodiversity

***Where:***

Global

***Description:***

"Integrated high-resolution maps of carbon stocks and biodiversity that identify areas of potential co-benefits for climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation can help facilitate the implementation of global climate and biodiversity commitments at local levels." ([Soto-Navarro et al 2020](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2019.0128)).

-   Harmonized global map of above- and below-ground terrestrial carbon storage (tonnes (t) of C per hectare (ha)) in biomass and soil for the reference year 2010.

-   Local species-level metrics: Species Richness--Area of Habitat and Rarity-weighted Richness--Area of Habitat ([IUCN 2017](https://www.iucnredlist.org/)).

-   Local ecosystem intactness: [GLOBIO](https://www.globio.info/what-is-globio) Mean Species Abundance ([Alkemade et al 2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10021-009-9229-5)) and the [PREDICTS](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/our-work/biodiversity/predicts.html) Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII, [Newbold et al 2016](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aaf2201); [Hill et al 2018](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/311787v1.abstract))

-   Habitat condition: Biodiversity Habitat Index ([Ferrier et al 2004](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/54/12/1101/329621)).

***Limitations:***

Good for global and national priorities; however, limited use local users.

Uncertainty in inferring carbon stocks in land-use change scenarios.

Biodiversity metrics might no capture the full spectrum/status of biodiversity

***Strengths:***

simple and straightforward to calculate

***Potential future impacts/results:***

It allows the identification of

-   carbon and biodiversity hotspots (e.g., HJBL), and

-   the highest potential co-benefits for conservation and potential for ecossytem restoration
