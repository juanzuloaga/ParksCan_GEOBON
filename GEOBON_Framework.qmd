The Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network's ([GEO BON](https://geobon.org/#:~:text=GEO%20BON%20%E2%80%93%20The%20Group%20on%20Earth%20Observations%20Biodiversity%20Observation%20Network)) mission is to improve the acquisition, coordination and delivery of biodiversity observations and ecosystem services to multiple users including decision makers and the scientific community.

National BONs can act as national units and networks bringing biodiversity change data and information together. Sub-national BONs are strategic initiatives that can address specific needs and realities of multiple partners and respond to particular ecological conditions within the country. The development of national and sub-national BONs is also directly facilitated through the application of [BON in a Box](https://boninabox.geobon.org/).

The development of **essential variables** and **indicators** to measure, assess and monitor biodiversity and ecosystems services plays a central role in GEO BON and is aimed to inform effective management policies ([Navarro et al 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877343517301665)).
