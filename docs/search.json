    "text": "Presentation\nEcosystem services assessments rely on a range of methods and frameworks that can be used and adapted in the case of the Hudson Bay Lowlands. We discuss the two frameworks (SEEA and EEBVs) recommended by the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity’s (UN CBD) Global Biodiversity Framework (UN CBD, 2022) and the work done by the European Union’s assessment of ecosystems and their services.\n\n\nUN CBD Global Biodiversity Framework\n\nSEEA frameworkEESV framework\n\n\nThe most popular and widely tested framework, the United Nation’s System of Environmental Economic Accounting (SEEA), was designed to support national statistics offices include the value of ecosystems into economic reporting (SEEA, 2021). The goal of this framework is to account for the value of ecosystems in economic policy making in support of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The UN CBD recommends that all signatory parties report on their progress towards the Global Biodiversity Framework following the guidelines of outlined in the SEEA white paper (UN CBD, 2022). This framework relies on decades of work done by experts around the world and has been tested in a wide variety of regions from Europe to Asia, Africa and South America (Hein et al., 2020; NSO India, 2021;IBGE, 2021; S.A.N.B.I., in print). An increasing number of countries is adopting this framework, including the US and Canada. The SEEA framework requires the production of five “accounts” (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1. Ecosystem accounts in the UN SEEA framework and how they relate to each other. The framework requires estimating these accounts in space over a landscape to convert their ecological reality into a monetary valuation for policy. Figure from SEEA 2021.\nAn ecosystem extent account records the total land coverage of each type of ecosystem. A condition account then specifies in which state the ecosystem is, which is linked to its capacity to provide services. Two ecosystem services accounts (one in physical units and one in monetary terms) record the supply of services by the ecosystem and the use by people. Finally, a monetary ecosystem asset account holds the information on all the stocks of services and their change. Other thematic accounts, such as biodiversity or wetland accounts, can also be produced.\nThis framework provides clear guidelines on what accounts should contain, what specific terminology means and how to relate these accounts to each other. It was developed with input from a wide variety of scientific disciplines and aims to respect the ecological reality of the landscape first and then translate it into economic terms.\nMethodologies on how to measure and create accounts is flexible and can be site specific, many countries have produced accounts relying on modelling tools such as the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST; Sharp et al., 2020) or the ARtificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services (ARIES; Martinez-Lopez et al., 2019). However, the SEEA framework was designed with a specific goal in mind: measuring the monetary contribution of ecosystems to societal wellbeing, and therefore may not be sufficient to include diverse priorities and ways of knowing.\n\n\nThe Group on Earth Observations Global Biodiversity Network (GEO BON) recently proposed the Essential Ecosystem Services Variables (EESV) framework (Balvanera et al., 2022) following its successful development of essential biodiversity variables, currently implemented worldwide to monitor biodiversity (Pereira et al., 2013). The UN CBD also endorsed the EESV framework as means to support monitoring of ecosystem services and reporting to the Global Biodiversity Framework (UN CBD, 2022c). The EESV framework was designed to streamline and standardise the collection of data on ecosystem services. It proposes to focus on six classes of data to collect for any ecosystem service of interest (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2. Illustration of the Essential Ecosystem Services Variables framework. All six classes are highlighted in a distinct colour and exemplified with icons relevant to a fishery as an example of an ecosystem service. The abundance of fish is a measure of supply. The catch is a measure of use. The consumption of fish by people is a measure of demand. The cultural significance of the fishery is a measure of relational value. The monetary value of fish sales is a measure of instrumental value. The size of the fishing fleet is a measure of anthropogenic contribution. Monitoring these variables together makes understanding the changing state of an ecosystem service possible.\nThese six classes aim to holistically capture the complexity of an ecosystem service and understand how it may be changing in several dimensions. They also make reporting on the changing state of an ecosystem service feasible and policy relevant. These classes are ecological supply: the ecosystem structure and functions that influence its potential to deliver ecosystem services, use: the actualised appropriation of a service by humans, demand: the implicit of explicit desire for a service, anthropogenic contribution: the investments human make to increase ecological supply or use, instrumental value: the benefits obtained from a service and relational value: which seeks to include values held by a diverse group of stakeholders and their unique worldviews. This framework is relatively new and only one paper to date, written by our group, has attempted to implement the approach in a real system (Schwantes & Firkowski et al., in review). However, it is more flexible and holistic than the SEEA and designed to be useful for any purpose, including but not limited to accounting.\n\n\n\n\n\nEuropean Union’s assessment of ecosystems and their services\nThe European Union’s Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services (MAES) is a project aimed at assessing the ecosystems of all member states of the European Union for the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2020. Its recent completion provides baseline information on the status of European ecosystems to support policy decisions and evaluations of impact over the next decade. The work was done following a precise framework to ensure consistent reporting and methods across the continent.\nThis framework is framed around important policy questions and explicitly links societal needs to the environment (Figure 3; Maes et al., 2016). It was implemented across the continent through engagement with stakeholders working at different scales and governance levels using the international classification of ecosystem services (Haines-Young & Potschin, 2012). The assessment focused on all types of ecosystems, including marine regions. Each ecosystem type was first assessed individually (eg: forests, wetlands, marine ecosystems, …), followed by an integrative assessment to identify overlap and common policy concerns. Important policy concerns were then used to frame the assessment of pressures on ecosystems and estimate their condition.\nSome key results of this assessment include the unfavourable state of legally protected areas in Europe, the risk of pressures acting in synergy to worsen their impact and an overall decline in the ability of ecosystems to provide services, including timber, crop pollination, recreation and flood protection. This assessment further highlights the gaps in knowledge and the need for increased monitoring efforts in the region.\n\nFigure 3.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Presentation\nWe organized this document to provide a preliminary context of this initiative and facilitate the communication among all partners. It will be updated regularly as we get more information and feedback. It will be also the basis of a white paper.\n\n\nIntroduction\nThis initiative aims to improve knowledge and application of tools, approaches, and models that are appropriate at a Canadian scale for looking at how to address challenges, such as conservation of biodiversity, ecosystem carbon storage and traditional food security to support the establishment and active management and restoration of protected and conserved areas in the Hudson–James Bay Lowlands (HJBL).\nTools and approaches have been developed and applied in many countries and have been analyzed through several large processes (e.g., Methodological Assessment Report on Scenarios and Models of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES 2016)), yet their application has been limited in Canada. As Parks Canada develops new approaches for establishing new protected and conserved areas and enhances active management and restoration efforts to better address the dual crises of biodiversity conservation and climate change, there is a need to explore how to refine and apply these tools and models to ecosystems across Canada.\nIn this initiative, Parks Canada is asking GEO BON international community WHAT frameworks, models and tools HAVE WORKED in terms of informing decision making and policy to protect, manage and monitor biodiversity, ecosystem services (i.e., carbon storage) and traditional food security. Moreover, WHAT DOES NOT WORK and WHY?\n\n\nArea of interest\nThe Hudson-James Bay lowlands (HJBL) is located in the Mushkegowuk territory including various First nation communities: Attawapiskat First Nation, Taykwa Tagamou Nation, Kashechewan First Nation, Fort Albany First Nation, Moose Cree First Nation, Chapleau Cree First Nation, Missanabie Cree First Nation, and Weenusk First Nation (see Mushkegouk Council). It is located in northeast Canada, known also as theHudson Bay Plains ecozone in the provinces on Ontario, Manitoba and Quebec.\nThe interactive map below some important thematic layers:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelected features from these sources:\nCanada boundaries: open.canada.ca\nTreaties and territories: Native Land Digital\nEcozones (study area): National Ecological Framework\nProtected areas (raw data): World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA), downloading data using R interface wdpar.\n\n\nBackground\nIn 2021, Parks Canada Agency received funding for the Hudson–James Bay Lowlands Biodiversity Conservation and Sequestration Initiative. The goal of the Initiative is to work with a range of partners on studies regarding biodiversity conservation and the extent and quantity of carbon stocks and fluxes in wetland, peatland and coastal ecosystems in the Hudson–James Bay Lowlands (HJBL). This will advance understanding of:\na) ecological integrity of the Hudson-James Bay Lowlands;\nb) ecosystem carbon stocks dynamics (storage and sequestration);\nc) a full suite of other ecosystem services; and\nd) active management approaches to achieve biodiversity and carbon conservation co-benefits. In turn, these results will be used to develop approaches and practices to establish and effectively manage protected areas and Other Effective Conservation Measures (OECMs) on a landscape scale across Canada.\nTo situate and guide the work to be carried out in the HJBL with Indigenous and other partners, there is a need to compile and validate spatially-explicit and scale-appropriate tools and models appropriate for Canadian ecosystems.\nThere is also a need to consider how Traditional Knowledge can weave appropriately into these tools and models. One element of addressing this need, is to conduct a stocktaking and analysis of existing tools, approaches, and models that already exist, prior to developing or applying new ones.\n\n\nExpected results\n\nImproved knowledge of appropriate spatially-explicit, and scale-appropriate tools and models for biodiversity and carbon storage for the HJBL and other landscapes across Canada, including how these can support environmental reporting obligations. \nImproved understanding of frameworks and/or approaches that achieve biodiversity and carbon conservation co-benefits under different world views. \nImproved understanding of how to weave Traditional Knowledge systems into the application of identified tools and models.\n\n\n\nActivities\n\nPhase 1\n\nCompile and review relevant tools, approaches, and models developed in other countries and/or by other organizations.\n\n\n\nPhase 2\n\nCompile example case studies of application of relevant tools and approaches.\nConvene a workshop of federal, provincial/territorial, Indigenous, non-governmental, academic and international experts to explore appropriate tools and models for landscape across Canada. \nDevelop and deliver a discussion paper based on stocktaking exercise, case study analysis, and the outcome of the workshop with recommendations on appropriate tools and models, including the weaving of Traditional Knowledge into these that could be applied in the Hudson Bay-James Bay Lowlands and other landscapes across Canada.\n\n\n\nScope and expectations\nParks Canada is interested in compiling frameworks, methods, tools and case studies taking into account these criteria:\n\nEcosystem services: there are some preliminary priorities to explore within the wide range of ecological services :\n\nCarbon storage: HJBL harbor one of the most important peatland ecosystem in the world\nTraditional food security: there are some traditional food priorities for indigenous and local communities to explore: freshwater fisheries, berries and geese.\n\nBiodiversity: explore different levels of biodiversity (from species to ecosystems)\nSpatially-explicit, and scale-appropriate models and tools\nIntegrate multiple knowledge systems\nExpectations\n\nsupport active management\nprotect species and landscapes\ndevelop good practices for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services management\nInform decision and policy makers\nIdentify actions that can be implemented now (tactical) and others in the future\n\n\nGEO BON is interested in developing a subnational BON, which is is a network of scientists (international/national/regional), government agencies, Indigenous organizations and conservation groups working together to harmonize and integrate efforts to measure, assess and monitor biodiversity and ecosystem services. Parks Canada initiative in the Hudson-James Bay region is an excellent opportunity to start implementing the process for BON development, in particular the engagement phase.

    "text": "We discuss three general approaches for quantifying carbon storage and sequestration for ecosystem service assessments and show how these three approaches could be adapted to account for peatland carbon dynamics in the Hudson Bay Lowlands. A comparison of the strengths, limitations, and best practices of each approach can be found in Table 1 which was reprinted from Schwantes et al. (in review). All three approaches rely on local site-specific field surveys for calibration and validation.\n\nStratify and MultiplyDirect Remote SensingMass balance models\n\n\nThe first approach, Stratify and Multiply, relies on first stratifying or partitioning the study area into multiple unique land cover or ecosystem types (Goetz et al. 2009, Sharp et al. 2020, Martínez-López et al. 2019). A reference or average carbon stock value is assigned to each cover type. The area of each cover type is then multiplied by the cover type’s associated reference carbon stock value.\nMany ecosystem service modeling platforms use a Stratify & Multiply approach, including the ARtificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services, ARIES (Martínez-López et al. 2019) and the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs, InVEST (Sharp et al. 2020). Best practices include using local site-specific field surveys to derive reference carbon stock values and detailed site-specific land cover maps that account for environmental gradients that might influence carbon stock changes (e.g., climate, soil characteristics, species composition, management, degradation, elevation, site history, wetland type, ecozone, etc.).\nCarbon emissions can be assessed in a similar way. For example, maps of peatland types can be combined with estimates of Net Ecosystem Exchange and Methane emission rates compiled for each peatland type and region (Webster et al. 2018).\n\n\nThe second approach, Direct Remote Sensing, uses a statistical or machine learning model to relate soil carbon field measurements to remotely sensed observations and other geospatial layers (Goetz et al. 2009, Sothe et al. 2021). The Direct Remote Sensing approach captures spatial variability of carbon within land cover classes, which is often missed with the Stratify and Multiply approach. Best practices include using local site-specific field surveys for model calibration and validation as well as local site-specific geospatial layers for covariates (e.g., topography, slope, soil type, wetland type, ecosystem type, soil characteristics, ecozone, etc.).\nCarbon stock maps can be differenced to track changes over time. Another new approach relies on multi-temporal Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) to estimate changes in peatland elevation after a wildfire (Reddy et al. 2015). Peatlands are becoming more susceptible to wildfires due to lowering water tables under climate change and development (Turetsky et al. 2015).\n\n\nThe third approach, Mass balance models, account for all key carbon pools and flows of carbon between these pools over time (GFOI, 2016, Bona et al. 2020). Mass balance models can track changes in carbon due to natural processes such as growth and decay as well as drivers of change including land use, wildfires, water table depth, and permafrost thaw.\nMass balance models are especially useful for understanding peatland carbon dynamics because they can account for the balance between the uptake of carbon and the emission of methane (Bona et al. 2020). Furthermore, these models can track changes in carbon due to increases in peatland disturbances, including droughts, permafrost thaw, and fires under climate change (Bona et al. 2020, Harris et al. 2022). When peatland permafrost thaws, previously frozen carbon can be decomposed, thereby releasing carbon dioxide and methane (Hugelius et al. 2020).\nMany modeling approaches have been implemented to estimate peatland carbon stocks in Canada including (1) the Canadian model for peatlands (CaMP) which accounts for wildfire disturbances but currently not permafrost thaw (Bona et al. 2020, although permafrost thaw is currently being implemented), (2) dynamic global ecosystem models that incorporate permafrost dynamics (Chaudhary et al. 2017), and (3) inventory-based models (Hugelius et al. 2020) that can also account for abrupt permafrost thaw (Turetsky et al. 2020). Best practices include integrating local site-specific field data for calibration and validation as well as remotely sensed data for accurate spatially explicit disturbance detection (e.g., Zhou et al. 2021, Bona et al. 2020, Shaw et al. 2021).\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.
