GEO BON framework, is an overarching framework aimed to measure, assess and monitor biodiversity and ecosystem services.\nFor instance, some global integrated assessment frameworks (FAO-UN, 2020) offer guidance to nations and other stakeholders for implementing programs to monitor and report on peatland’s state and management: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), and The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. Other frameworks offer room to incorporate and evaluate some aspects of these ecosystems, for example: The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and Fire Monitoring Initiatives (e.g.,FireMARS Canada). However, spatially explicit assessment and impact evaluation is not fully supported and integrated by these frameworks.\nGEO BON is a framework to measure, monitor, assess and report all levels of biodiversity (genetic, populations, communities, species and ecosystems) and recently ecosystem services. It provides spatial explicit tools that can be applied at different spatial scales (from local to national and global). Integrating multiple knowledge system is also fundamental part of GEO BON development.\nIn the next sections, we start describing the GEO BON framework, followed by three sections: ecosystem services (, essential variables and indicators. Finally we present some multiple/dual frameworks attempting to prevent simultaneously overarching biodiversity threats, for instance biodiversity loss and climate change."

    "text": "We discuss three general approaches for quantifying carbon storage and sequestration for ecosystem service assessments and show how these three approaches could be adapted to account for peatland carbon dynamics in the Hudson Bay Lowlands. A comparison of the strengths, limitations, and best practices of each approach can be found in Table 1 which was reprinted from Schwantes et al. (in review). All three approaches rely on local site-specific field surveys for calibration and validation.\n\nStratify and MultiplyDirect Remote SensingMass balance models\n\n\nThe first approach, Stratify and Multiply, relies on first stratifying or partitioning the study area into multiple unique land cover or ecosystem types (Goetz et al. 2009, Sharp et al. 2020, Martínez-López et al. 2019). A reference or average carbon stock value is assigned to each cover type. The area of each cover type is then multiplied by the cover type’s associated reference carbon stock value.\nMany ecosystem service modeling platforms use a Stratify & Multiply approach, including the ARtificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services, ARIES (Martínez-López et al. 2019) and the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs, InVEST (Sharp et al. 2020). Best practices include using local site-specific field surveys to derive reference carbon stock values and detailed site-specific land cover maps that account for environmental gradients that might influence carbon stock changes (e.g., climate, soil characteristics, species composition, management, degradation, elevation, site history, wetland type, ecozone, etc.).\nCarbon emissions can be assessed in a similar way. For example, maps of peatland types can be combined with estimates of Net Ecosystem Exchange and Methane emission rates compiled for each peatland type and region (Webster et al. 2018).\n\n\nThe second approach, Direct Remote Sensing, uses a statistical or machine learning model to relate soil carbon field measurements to remotely sensed observations and other geospatial layers (Goetz et al. 2009, Sothe et al. 2021). The Direct Remote Sensing approach captures spatial variability of carbon within land cover classes, which is often missed with the Stratify and Multiply approach. Best practices include using local site-specific field surveys for model calibration and validation as well as local site-specific geospatial layers for covariates (e.g., topography, slope, soil type, wetland type, ecosystem type, soil characteristics, ecozone, etc.).\nCarbon stock maps can be differenced to track changes over time. Another new approach relies on multi-temporal Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) to estimate changes in peatland elevation after a wildfire (Reddy et al. 2015). Peatlands are becoming more susceptible to wildfires due to lowering water tables under climate change and development (Turetsky et al. 2015).\n\n\nThe third approach, Mass balance models, account for all key carbon pools and flows of carbon between these pools over time (GFOI, 2016, Bona et al. 2020). Mass balance models can track changes in carbon due to natural processes such as growth and decay as well as drivers of change including land use, wildfires, water table depth, and permafrost thaw.\nMass balance models are especially useful for understanding peatland carbon dynamics because they can account for the balance between the uptake of carbon and the emission of methane (Bona et al. 2020). Furthermore, these models can track changes in carbon due to increases in peatland disturbances, including droughts, permafrost thaw, and fires under climate change (Bona et al. 2020, Harris et al. 2022). When peatland permafrost thaws, previously frozen carbon can be decomposed, thereby releasing carbon dioxide and methane (Hugelius et al. 2020).\nMany modeling approaches have been implemented to estimate peatland carbon stocks in Canada including (1) the Canadian model for peatlands (CaMP) which accounts for wildfire disturbances but currently not permafrost thaw (Bona et al. 2020, although permafrost thaw is currently being implemented), (2) dynamic global ecosystem models that incorporate permafrost dynamics (Chaudhary et al. 2017), and (3) inventory-based models (Hugelius et al. 2020) that can also account for abrupt permafrost thaw (Turetsky et al. 2020). Best practices include integrating local site-specific field data for calibration and validation as well as remotely sensed data for accurate spatially explicit disturbance detection (e.g., Zhou et al. 2021, Bona et al. 2020, Shaw et al. 2021).\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Stratify & Multiply Approach multiply land use and land cover (LULC) maps with reference carbon stocks by LULC type\n\n·       Easy to acquire the necessary data\n·       Low financial costs for implementation\n\n·       Typically, doesn’t account for variability within land cover classes (e.g., due to successional changes over time, climate, soil type, degradation, species composition, management)\n·       Difficult to account for global change drivers other than land cover change, the effect of time lags, site history, and novel or mixed ecosystem types\n\n·       Use detailed land cover class maps that account for species-specific forest types, forest stand-age, permanent crop type, climate, soils, and management\n·       Use locally derived reference carbon stocks and stock change factors instead of default values from IPCC wherever possible\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nII. Direct Remote Sensing Approach link remote sensing data with field measurements using statistical and machine learning models\n\n·       Account for spatial heterogeneity of carbon within land cover classes.\n·       Account for spatial heterogeneity in areas where the land use or cover is uncertain (e.g., mixed ecosystems, ecosystems in transition, novel ecosystems).\n\n·       Maps are not easily updated each year and hence are often only available for snapshots in time\n\n·       Validate and calibrate with local site-specific field surveys\n·       Develop automated algorithms that are easily updated each year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIII. Mass Balance Approach model key carbon pools and flows between them\n\n·       Assess carbon stock changes across multiple pools through time\n·       Account for many drivers of change including urbanization, harvest, wildfires, and droughts\n\n·       Models will be most accurate if locally calibrated (e.g., use local site-specific field surveys for input data to improve model accuracy)\n·       Often computationally intensive\n·       Require user expertise\n·       Outputs are not always spatially explicit, but rather spatially referenced to coarser scale reporting areas, which can limit uses that require fine-scale spatially explicit carbon estimates\n\n·       Integrate field measurements for model calibration and validation\n·       Integrate remote sensing data for accurate disturbance detection (e.g., harvest, wildfires, LULC change)"

    "text": "We discuss three general approaches for quantifying carbon storage for ecosystem services assessments and show how these three approaches could be adapted to account for peatland carbon dynamics in the Hudson Bay Lowlands. A comparison of the strengths, limitations, and best practices of each approach can be found in Table 1 which was reprinted from Schwantes et al. (in review). All three approaches rely on local site-specific field surveys for calibration and validation.\n\nStratify and MultiplyDirect Remote SensingMass balance models\n\n\nThe first approach, Stratify and Multiply, relies on first stratifying or partitioning the study area into multiple unique land cover or ecosystem types (Goetz et al. 2009, Sharp et al. 2020, Martínez-López et al. 2019). A reference or average carbon stock value is assigned to each cover type. The area of each cover type is then multiplied by the cover type’s associated reference carbon stock value.\nMany ecosystem service modeling platforms use a Stratify & Multiply approach, including the ARtificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services, ARIES (Martínez-López et al. 2019) and the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs, InVEST (Sharp et al. 2020). Best practices include using local site-specific field surveys to derive reference carbon stock values and detailed site-specific land cover maps that account for environmental gradients that might influence carbon stock changes (e.g., climate, soil characteristics, species composition, management, degradation, elevation, site history, wetland type, ecozone, etc.).\nCarbon emissions can be assessed in a similar way. For example, maps of peatland types can be combined with estimates of Net Ecosystem Exchange and Methane emission rates compiled for each peatland type and region (Webster et al. 2018).\n\n\nThe second approach, Direct Remote Sensing, uses a statistical or machine learning model to relate soil carbon field measurements to remotely sensed observations and other geospatial layers (Goetz et al. 2009, Sothe et al. 2021). The Direct Remote Sensing approach captures spatial variability of carbon within land cover classes, which is often missed with the Stratify and Multiply approach. Best practices include using local site-specific field surveys for model calibration and validation as well as local site-specific geospatial layers for covariates (e.g., topography, slope, soil type, wetland type, ecosystem type, soil characteristics, ecozone, etc.).\nCarbon stock maps can be differenced to track changes over time. Another new approach relies on multi-temporal Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) to estimate changes in peatland elevation after a wildfire (Reddy et al. 2015). Peatlands are becoming more susceptible to wildfires due to lowering water tables under climate change and development (Turetsky et al. 2015).\n\n\nThe third approach, Mass balance models, account for all key carbon pools and flows of carbon between these pools over time (GFOI, 2016, Bona et al. 2020). Mass balance models can track changes in carbon due to natural processes such as growth and decay as well as drivers of change including land use, wildfires, water table depth, and permafrost thaw.\nMass balance models are especially useful for understanding peatland carbon dynamics because they can account for the balance between the uptake of carbon and the emission of methane (Bona et al. 2020). Furthermore, these models can track changes in carbon due to increases in peatland disturbances, including droughts, permafrost thaw, and fires under climate change (Bona et al. 2020, Harris et al. 2022). When peatland permafrost thaws, previously frozen carbon can be decomposed, thereby releasing carbon dioxide and methane (Hugelius et al. 2020).\nMany modeling approaches have been implemented to estimate peatland carbon stocks in Canada including (1) the Canadian model for peatlands (CaMP) which accounts for wildfire disturbances but currently not permafrost thaw (Bona et al. 2020, although permafrost thaw is currently being implemented), (2) dynamic global ecosystem models that incorporate permafrost dynamics (Chaudhary et al. 2017), and (3) inventory-based models (Hugelius et al. 2020) that can also account for abrupt permafrost thaw (Turetsky et al. 2020). Best practices include integrating local site-specific field data for calibration and validation as well as remotely sensed data for accurate spatially explicit disturbance detection (e.g., Zhou et al. 2021, Bona et al. 2020, Shaw et al. 2021).\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

    "text": "Introduction\nin progress….\nFood security relates to the fundamental human right of access to food (United Nations, 1948). Specifically, food security is achieved when a reliable supply of food is available for a region/people (Mbow et al., 2019). In historically ostracised and remote communities, food security is a fundamental issue (Salomon et al., 2020). The impact of colonial practices on indigenous people around the world has resulted in many communities losing their food sovereignty and security (Whyte, 2018). In a time of reconciliation, efforts to revitalise traditional practices and return rights to indigenous people must address food security problems (Chuenpagdee and Jentoft, 2019).\nHere we present two main traditional food activities that are crucial for indigenous and local communities in the HJBL: freshwater fisheries and foraging wild foods.\nMany indigenous communities around the world face issues of food security, especially in remote areas. However, not all communities suffer from the same rates of food insecurity, even within similar ecological regions, for example about 25% of households in Western Alaska are food insecure compared to 69% in Nunavut (Chuenpagdee and Jentoft, 2019). In fact, Nunavut has the highest rate of food insecurity for any indigenous population living in a developed country (Council of Canadian Academies, 2014). Culture, history, local practices, environmental change, logistics and governance systems all play a role in food security outcomes. Figure 1 presents a conceptual framework for understanding the multiple contributors to food security in modern indigenous communities.\nFigure 1. presents a conceptual framework for understanding the multiple contributors to food security in modern indigenous communities.\n\nFigure 1. A conceptual representation of the multiple factors affecting food security in the Canadian North. “This dynamic, holistic, people-centred framework is a tool for analyzing and understanding food security and food sovereignty in northern Canada. The wheel represents the complex interplay between factors that affect northern Aboriginal peoples, and how food security and food sovereignty emerge from these relationships. Because the framework is fluid, no single factor should be interpreted as static or merely linked to the factor to which it is most closely positioned. Each factor is understood to have multiple relationships with other concepts within the wheel.” From Council of Canadian Academies, 2014."

Peat soils hold an estimated 650 billion tonnes (Gt = Pg) of carbon on only 3 percent of the Earth’s land surface – a carbon store that is equal in magnitude to the amount of carbon in the Earth’s vegetation, and more than half of the carbon in the atmosphere (Yu et al., 2010; Page et al., 2011; Dargie et al., 2017). Peatlands thus play a critical role in the global carbon cycle and in climate regulation. However, peatlands also deliver a range of other benefits for humanity, including water regulation, flood control, food, and cultural and livelihood opportunities.

As Parks Canada develops new approaches for establishing new protected and conserved areas and enhances active management and restoration efforts to better address the dual crises of biodiversity conservation and climate change, there is a need to explore how to refine and apply these tools and models to ecosystems across Canada.\nIn this initiative, Parks Canada is asking the GEO BON international community:\n\nWhat frameworks, models and tools have successfully worked in terms of informing decision making and policy to protect, manage and monitor biodiversity, ecosystem services (i.e., carbon storage) and traditional food security (e.g., freshwater fisheries, foraging wild fruits). Moreover, what has not worked? and Why?\nHow can we implement these methods and tools in the HBJL where biodiversity and carbon data and information are sparse?\nHow can we weave multiple knowledge systems in the application of these models and tools?"

    "section": "Background",
    "text": "Background\nIn 2021, Parks Canada Agency received funding for the Hudson–James Bay Lowlands Biodiversity Conservation and Sequestration Initiative. The goal of the Initiative is to work with a range of partners on studies regarding biodiversity conservation and the extent and quantity of carbon stocks and fluxes in wetland, peatland and coastal ecosystems in the Hudson–James Bay Lowlands (HJBL). This will advance understanding of:\na) ecological integrity of the Hudson-James Bay Lowlands;\nb) ecosystem carbon stocks dynamics (storage and sequestration);\nc) a full suite of other ecosystem services; and\nd) active management approaches to achieve biodiversity and carbon conservation co-benefits. In turn, these results will be used to develop approaches and practices to establish and effectively manage protected areas and Other Effective Conservation Measures (OECMs) on a landscape scale across Canada.\nTo situate and guide the work to be carried out in the HJBL with Indigenous and other partners, there is a need to compile and validate spatially-explicit and scale-appropriate tools and models appropriate for Canadian ecosystems.\nThere is also a need to consider how Traditional Knowledge can weave appropriately into these tools and models. One element of addressing this need, is to conduct a stocktaking and analysis of existing tools, approaches, and models that already exist, prior to developing or applying new ones."

    "text": "2. Ecosystem services\nEcosystem services assessments rely on a range of methods and frameworks that can be used and adapted in the case of the Hudson Bay Lowlands. We discuss the two frameworks recommended by the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity’s (UN CBD) Global Biodiversity Framework (UN CBD, 2022): The System of Environmental Economic Accounting (SEEA) and The Essential Ecosystem Services Variables (EEBVs); and the work done by the European Union’s assessment of ecosystems and their services.\n\n2.1. UN CBD Global Biodiversity Framework\n\n\n\nSEEA frameworkEESV framework\n\n\nThe most popular and widely tested framework, the United Nation’s System of Environmental Economic Accounting (SEEA), was designed to support national statistics offices include the value of ecosystems into economic reporting (SEEA, 2021). The goal of this framework is to account for the value of ecosystems in economic policy making in support of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The UN CBD recommends that all signatory parties report on their progress towards the Global Biodiversity Framework following the guidelines of outlined in the SEEA white paper (UN CBD, 2022). This framework relies on decades of work done by experts around the world and has been tested in a wide variety of regions from Europe to Asia, Africa and South America (Hein et al., 2020; NSO India, 2021;IBGE, 2021; S.A.N.B.I., in print). An increasing number of countries is adopting this framework, including the US and Canada. The SEEA framework requires the production of five “accounts” (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1. Ecosystem accounts in the UN SEEA framework and how they relate to each other. The framework requires estimating these accounts in space over a landscape to convert their ecological reality into a monetary valuation for policy. Figure from SEEA 2021.\nAn ecosystem extent account records the total land coverage of each type of ecosystem. A condition account then specifies in which state the ecosystem is, which is linked to its capacity to provide services. Two ecosystem services accounts (one in physical units and one in monetary terms) record the supply of services by the ecosystem and the use by people. Finally, a monetary ecosystem asset account holds the information on all the stocks of services and their change. Other thematic accounts, such as biodiversity or wetland accounts, can also be produced.\nThis framework provides clear guidelines on what accounts should contain, what specific terminology means and how to relate these accounts to each other. It was developed with input from a wide variety of scientific disciplines and aims to respect the ecological reality of the landscape first and then translate it into economic terms.\nMethodologies on how to measure and create accounts is flexible and can be site specific, many countries have produced accounts relying on modelling tools such as the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST; Sharp et al., 2020) or the ARtificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services (ARIES; Martinez-Lopez et al., 2019). However, the SEEA framework was designed with a specific goal in mind: measuring the monetary contribution of ecosystems to societal wellbeing, and therefore may not be sufficient to include diverse priorities and ways of knowing.\n\n\nThe Group on Earth Observations Global Biodiversity Network (GEO BON) recently proposed the Essential Ecosystem Services Variables (EESV) framework (Balvanera et al., 2022) following its successful development of essential biodiversity variables, currently implemented worldwide to monitor biodiversity (Pereira et al., 2013). The UN CBD also endorsed the EESV framework as means to support monitoring of ecosystem services and reporting to the Global Biodiversity Framework (UN CBD, 2022c). The EESV framework was designed to streamline and standardise the collection of data on ecosystem services. It proposes to focus on six classes of data to collect for any ecosystem service of interest (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2. Illustration of the Essential Ecosystem Services Variables framework. All six classes are highlighted in a distinct colour and exemplified with icons relevant to a fishery as an example of an ecosystem service. The abundance of fish is a measure of supply. The catch is a measure of use. The consumption of fish by people is a measure of demand. The cultural significance of the fishery is a measure of relational value. The monetary value of fish sales is a measure of instrumental value. The size of the fishing fleet is a measure of anthropogenic contribution. Monitoring these variables together makes understanding the changing state of an ecosystem service possible.\nThese six classes aim to holistically capture the complexity of an ecosystem service and understand how it may be changing in several dimensions. They also make reporting on the changing state of an ecosystem service feasible and policy relevant. These classes are ecological supply: the ecosystem structure and functions that influence its potential to deliver ecosystem services, use: the actualised appropriation of a service by humans, demand: the implicit of explicit desire for a service, anthropogenic contribution: the investments human make to increase ecological supply or use, instrumental value: the benefits obtained from a service and relational value: which seeks to include values held by a diverse group of stakeholders and their unique worldviews. This framework is relatively new and only one paper to date, written by our group, has attempted to implement the approach in a real system (Schwantes & Firkowski et al., in review). However, it is more flexible and holistic than the SEEA and designed to be useful for any purpose, including but not limited to accounting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2. European Union’s assessment of ecosystems and their services\nThe European Union’s Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services (MAES) is a project aimed at assessing the ecosystems of all member states of the European Union for the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2020. Its recent completion provides baseline information on the status of European ecosystems to support policy decisions and evaluations of impact over the next decade. The work was done following a precise framework to ensure consistent reporting and methods across the continent.\nThis framework is framed around important policy questions and explicitly links societal needs to the environment (Figure 3; Maes et al., 2016). It was implemented across the continent through engagement with stakeholders working at different scales and governance levels using the international classification of ecosystem services (Haines-Young & Potschin, 2012). The assessment focused on all types of ecosystems, including marine regions. Each ecosystem type was first assessed individually (eg: forests, wetlands, marine ecosystems, …), followed by an integrative assessment to identify overlap and common policy concerns. Important policy concerns were then used to frame the assessment of pressures on ecosystems and estimate their condition.\nSome key results of this assessment include the unfavourable state of legally protected areas in Europe, the risk of pressures acting in synergy to worsen their impact and an overall decline in the ability of ecosystems to provide services, including timber, crop pollination, recreation and flood protection. This assessment further highlights the gaps in knowledge and the need for increased monitoring efforts in the region.\n\nFigure 3. The conceptual framework for EU and national assessments of the EU Biodiversity Strategy (from Maes et al., 2016)."

They analyse some essential variables per service in a spatially explicit way using available data from government and private sources.\n\nFigure . (a) Study areas in British Columbia, Canada for three case studies: water quality regulation (Salmon River watershed), wild food provisioning through Chinook salmon fisheries (Fraser Basin), and orca whale-watching (foraging area in the Pacific Ocean; Fisheries and Oceans Canada 2018). (b) Conceptual figure illustrating the EESV classes and drivers of change for each case study. Interactions can occur within and among ESs through the EESV classes. For example, water quality degradation from pollution and rising temperatures coupled with overfishing may lead to Chinook population crashes which in turn may cascade to reduce orca whale-watching through orca population declines."

    "text": "1. UN CBD Global Biodiversity Framework\n\nSEEA frameworkEESV framework\n\n\nThe most popular and widely tested framework, the United Nation’s System of Environmental Economic Accounting (SEEA), was designed to support national statistics offices include the value of ecosystems into economic reporting (SEEA, 2021). The goal of this framework is to account for the value of ecosystems in economic policy making in support of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The UN CBD recommends that all signatory parties report on their progress towards the Global Biodiversity Framework following the guidelines of outlined in the SEEA white paper (UN CBD, 2022). This framework relies on decades of work done by experts around the world and has been tested in a wide variety of regions from Europe to Asia, Africa and South America (Hein et al., 2020; NSO India, 2021;IBGE, 2021; S.A.N.B.I., in print). An increasing number of countries is adopting this framework, including the US and Canada. The SEEA framework requires the production of five “accounts” (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1. Ecosystem accounts in the UN SEEA framework and how they relate to each other. The framework requires estimating these accounts in space over a landscape to convert their ecological reality into a monetary valuation for policy. Figure from SEEA 2021.\nAn ecosystem extent account records the total land coverage of each type of ecosystem. A condition account then specifies in which state the ecosystem is, which is linked to its capacity to provide services. Two ecosystem services accounts (one in physical units and one in monetary terms) record the supply of services by the ecosystem and the use by people. Finally, a monetary ecosystem asset account holds the information on all the stocks of services and their change. Other thematic accounts, such as biodiversity or wetland accounts, can also be produced.\nThis framework provides clear guidelines on what accounts should contain, what specific terminology means and how to relate these accounts to each other. It was developed with input from a wide variety of scientific disciplines and aims to respect the ecological reality of the landscape first and then translate it into economic terms.\nMethodologies on how to measure and create accounts is flexible and can be site specific, many countries have produced accounts relying on modelling tools such as the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST; Sharp et al., 2020) or the ARtificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services (ARIES; Martinez-Lopez et al., 2019). However, the SEEA framework was designed with a specific goal in mind: measuring the monetary contribution of ecosystems to societal wellbeing, and therefore may not be sufficient to include diverse priorities and ways of knowing.\n\n\nThe Group on Earth Observations Global Biodiversity Network (GEO BON) recently proposed the Essential Ecosystem Services Variables (EESV) framework (Balvanera et al., 2022) following its successful development of essential biodiversity variables, currently implemented worldwide to monitor biodiversity (Pereira et al., 2013). The UN CBD also endorsed the EESV framework as means to support monitoring of ecosystem services and reporting to the Global Biodiversity Framework (UN CBD, 2022c). The EESV framework was designed to streamline and standardise the collection of data on ecosystem services. It proposes to focus on six classes of data to collect for any ecosystem service of interest (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2. Illustration of the Essential Ecosystem Services Variables framework. All six classes are highlighted in a distinct colour and exemplified with icons relevant to a fishery as an example of an ecosystem service. The abundance of fish is a measure of supply. The catch is a measure of use. The consumption of fish by people is a measure of demand. The cultural significance of the fishery is a measure of relational value. The monetary value of fish sales is a measure of instrumental value. The size of the fishing fleet is a measure of anthropogenic contribution. Monitoring these variables together makes understanding the changing state of an ecosystem service possible.\nThese six classes aim to holistically capture the complexity of an ecosystem service and understand how it may be changing in several dimensions. They also make reporting on the changing state of an ecosystem service feasible and policy relevant. These classes are ecological supply: the ecosystem structure and functions that influence its potential to deliver ecosystem services, use: the actualised appropriation of a service by humans, demand: the implicit of explicit desire for a service, anthropogenic contribution: the investments human make to increase ecological supply or use, instrumental value: the benefits obtained from a service and relational value: which seeks to include values held by a diverse group of stakeholders and their unique worldviews. This framework is relatively new and only one paper to date, written by our group, has attempted to implement the approach in a real system (Schwantes & Firkowski et al., in review). However, it is more flexible and holistic than the SEEA and designed to be useful for any purpose, including but not limited to accounting."

European Union’s assessment of ecosystems and their services\nThe European Union’s Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services (MAES) is a project aimed at assessing the ecosystems of all member states of the European Union for the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2020. Its recent completion provides baseline information on the status of European ecosystems to support policy decisions and evaluations of impact over the next decade. The work was done following a precise framework to ensure consistent reporting and methods across the continent.\nThis framework is framed around important policy questions and explicitly links societal needs to the environment (Figure 3; Maes et al., 2016). It was implemented across the continent through engagement with stakeholders working at different scales and governance levels using the international classification of ecosystem services (Haines-Young & Potschin, 2012). The assessment focused on all types of ecosystems, including marine regions. Each ecosystem type was first assessed individually (eg: forests, wetlands, marine ecosystems, …), followed by an integrative assessment to identify overlap and common policy concerns. Important policy concerns were then used to frame the assessment of pressures on ecosystems and estimate their condition.\nSome key results of this assessment include the unfavourable state of legally protected areas in Europe, the risk of pressures acting in synergy to worsen their impact and an overall decline in the ability of ecosystems to provide services, including timber, crop pollination, recreation and flood protection. This assessment further highlights the gaps in knowledge and the need for increased monitoring efforts in the region.\n\nFigure 3.

In the Prairie example, reference carbon stocks were obtained using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) default stock values for wetland soils along with stock change factors for land use (e.g., cultivated, hydrologically restored) to estimate wetland soil organic carbon (Ducks Unlimited Canada 2015). For the Boreal Plains example, first the study region was classified into 19 different wetland classes using Landsat data. Then the average value of carbon was calculated for each wetland class using data from the Zoltai Database and Canada’s National Forest Inventory. Lastly, carbon storage maps were obtained by applying the average value of carbon within each wetland class to the area assigned as that wetland class (Ducks Unlimited Canada 2015).\nLimitations:\nThese types of methods do not account for spatial variability of carbon within land cover classes. It is difficult to account for differences in carbon due to other factors, such as local hydrological factors, salinity, climate, and site history. Moreover, the Prairie example used default IPCC values; however, using locally derived reference carbon stock values and stock change factors would improve accuracy and lower uncertainty.\nStrengths:\nIt is relatively easy to acquire the necessary data and there are low financial costs.\nActions:\nThe project updated Alberta’s Wetland Restoration Offset Protocol to align with IPCC guidelines.\nImpacts/results (potential and/or measured):\nThe report suggests that this tool could be useful to develop conservation offset programs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMapping Canada’s Carbon Landscapes by the World Wildlife Fund Canada\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere:\nCanada\nDescription:\nRemote Sensing approaches are often used to link field estimates of carbon with remotely sensed imagery, using a machine learning or statistical model. Sothe et al. (2021) used a machine learning approach to estimate carbon stocks in plants and soils across all terrestrial ecosystems in Canada. Field measurements of soil carbon were obtained from the World Soil Information Service and the Lehigh University Peatlands Database. Field estimates of aboveground biomass were obtained from provincial databases and Canada’s National Forest Inventory. A random forest algorithm was used to link the field data to covariates available at a regional level (e.g., Landsat-8, MODIS, Sentinel-2, elevation, topography, Synthetic Aperture Radar, soil type, climate). Postprocessing steps included limiting the depth of soil organic carbon estimates to the maximum rooting depth and reducing soil organic carbon in areas with high ground ice abundance (Sothe et al. 2021).\nLimitations:\nThese carbon storage maps (WWF, 2022) take significant time and funding to develop, and thus are not often updated each year; therefore, rarely is this type of method used to assess changes in carbon over time. Moreover, these carbon storage maps are only as good as the data that goes into them; therefore, it is imperative to use local site-specific field measurements of carbon for calibration and validation. Lastly, the model was developed using data at a national scale to estimate carbon across Canada; however, the same approach could be applied using data restricted to a smaller study region (e.g., Hudson Bay), which may lower uncertainty and improve accuracy. By restricting the analysis to a smaller study region, covariates that best explain the region’s dominant environmental gradients could be included, which would likely improve the accuracy.\nStrengths:\nUnlike the Stratify and Multiply approach, this approach can account for the spatial heterogeneity of carbon within land cover classes, and in areas of mixed ecosystems, transitioning ecosystems, or novel ecosystems.\nActions:\n\nWWF Canada used these carbon maps to advocate for conservation action within the Wolastoq/Saint John River watershed in New Brunswick.\nCollaborations with the Mushkegowuk council, WWF-Canada, and McMaster University will collect field data to validate these maps. The field data will hopefully support the creation of Indigenous-led conservation areas and influence decisions surrounding cumulative impact assessments prior to development in the Ring of Fire.\n\nImpacts/results (potential and/or measured):\nThe report suggests these carbon storage maps could (1) help in the protection and management of these landscapes through for example nature-based climate solutions, and (2) demonstrate the importance of supporting Guardians Programs and Indigenous Protected and Conserved Areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Canadian model for peatlands (CaMP)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere:\nCanada\nDescription:\nThe Canadian model for peatlands (CaMP) is a peatland carbon model, capable of tracking key carbon pools (e.g., trees & shrubs, sedges, mosses, litter, peat (acrotelm, catotelm)) and flows between them (e.g., growth, mortality, decomposition) for peatland ecosystems. It currently only includes wildfire as a disturbance; however, updates are planned to include other disturbances such as permafrost thaw and anthropogenic disturbances (Bona et al. 2020).\nLimitations:\nThese models typically require extensive user expertise to run and parameterize.\nStrengths:\nThese models provide accurate assessments of changes in carbon stocks and flows over time. Also, CaMP models peatland hydrology and methane emissions. Currently, CaMP accounts for wildfire disturbances, with plans to account for other disturbances such as permafrost thaw in future versions.\nImpacts/results (potential and/or measured):\nCaMP was developed to be used for national greenhouse gas emission and removal reporting in Canada."
