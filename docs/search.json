    "text": "Presentation\nEcosystem services assessments rely on a range of methods and frameworks that can be used and adapted in the case of the Hudson Bay Lowlands. We discuss the two frameworks recommended by the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity’s (UN CBD) Global Biodiversity Framework (UN CBD, 2022): The System of Environmental Economic Accounting (SEEA) and The Essential Ecosystem Services Variables (EEBVs); and the work done by the European Union’s assessment of ecosystems and their services.\n\n\nUN CBD Global Biodiversity Framework\n\nSEEA frameworkEESV framework\n\n\nThe most popular and widely tested framework, the United Nation’s System of Environmental Economic Accounting (SEEA), was designed to support national statistics offices include the value of ecosystems into economic reporting (SEEA, 2021). The goal of this framework is to account for the value of ecosystems in economic policy making in support of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The UN CBD recommends that all signatory parties report on their progress towards the Global Biodiversity Framework following the guidelines of outlined in the SEEA white paper (UN CBD, 2022). This framework relies on decades of work done by experts around the world and has been tested in a wide variety of regions from Europe to Asia, Africa and South America (Hein et al., 2020; NSO India, 2021;IBGE, 2021; S.A.N.B.I., in print). An increasing number of countries is adopting this framework, including the US and Canada. The SEEA framework requires the production of five “accounts” (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1. Ecosystem accounts in the UN SEEA framework and how they relate to each other. The framework requires estimating these accounts in space over a landscape to convert their ecological reality into a monetary valuation for policy. Figure from SEEA 2021.\nAn ecosystem extent account records the total land coverage of each type of ecosystem. A condition account then specifies in which state the ecosystem is, which is linked to its capacity to provide services. Two ecosystem services accounts (one in physical units and one in monetary terms) record the supply of services by the ecosystem and the use by people. Finally, a monetary ecosystem asset account holds the information on all the stocks of services and their change. Other thematic accounts, such as biodiversity or wetland accounts, can also be produced.\nThis framework provides clear guidelines on what accounts should contain, what specific terminology means and how to relate these accounts to each other. It was developed with input from a wide variety of scientific disciplines and aims to respect the ecological reality of the landscape first and then translate it into economic terms.\nMethodologies on how to measure and create accounts is flexible and can be site specific, many countries have produced accounts relying on modelling tools such as the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST; Sharp et al., 2020) or the ARtificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services (ARIES; Martinez-Lopez et al., 2019). However, the SEEA framework was designed with a specific goal in mind: measuring the monetary contribution of ecosystems to societal wellbeing, and therefore may not be sufficient to include diverse priorities and ways of knowing.\n\n\nThe Group on Earth Observations Global Biodiversity Network (GEO BON) recently proposed the Essential Ecosystem Services Variables (EESV) framework (Balvanera et al., 2022) following its successful development of essential biodiversity variables, currently implemented worldwide to monitor biodiversity (Pereira et al., 2013). The UN CBD also endorsed the EESV framework as means to support monitoring of ecosystem services and reporting to the Global Biodiversity Framework (UN CBD, 2022c). The EESV framework was designed to streamline and standardise the collection of data on ecosystem services. It proposes to focus on six classes of data to collect for any ecosystem service of interest (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2. Illustration of the Essential Ecosystem Services Variables framework. All six classes are highlighted in a distinct colour and exemplified with icons relevant to a fishery as an example of an ecosystem service. The abundance of fish is a measure of supply. The catch is a measure of use. The consumption of fish by people is a measure of demand. The cultural significance of the fishery is a measure of relational value. The monetary value of fish sales is a measure of instrumental value. The size of the fishing fleet is a measure of anthropogenic contribution. Monitoring these variables together makes understanding the changing state of an ecosystem service possible.\nThese six classes aim to holistically capture the complexity of an ecosystem service and understand how it may be changing in several dimensions. They also make reporting on the changing state of an ecosystem service feasible and policy relevant. These classes are ecological supply: the ecosystem structure and functions that influence its potential to deliver ecosystem services, use: the actualised appropriation of a service by humans, demand: the implicit of explicit desire for a service, anthropogenic contribution: the investments human make to increase ecological supply or use, instrumental value: the benefits obtained from a service and relational value: which seeks to include values held by a diverse group of stakeholders and their unique worldviews. This framework is relatively new and only one paper to date, written by our group, has attempted to implement the approach in a real system (Schwantes & Firkowski et al., in review). However, it is more flexible and holistic than the SEEA and designed to be useful for any purpose, including but not limited to accounting.\n\n\n\n\n\nEuropean Union’s assessment of ecosystems and their services\nThe European Union’s Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services (MAES) is a project aimed at assessing the ecosystems of all member states of the European Union for the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2020. Its recent completion provides baseline information on the status of European ecosystems to support policy decisions and evaluations of impact over the next decade. The work was done following a precise framework to ensure consistent reporting and methods across the continent.\nThis framework is framed around important policy questions and explicitly links societal needs to the environment (Figure 3; Maes et al., 2016). It was implemented across the continent through engagement with stakeholders working at different scales and governance levels using the international classification of ecosystem services (Haines-Young & Potschin, 2012). The assessment focused on all types of ecosystems, including marine regions. Each ecosystem type was first assessed individually (eg: forests, wetlands, marine ecosystems, …), followed by an integrative assessment to identify overlap and common policy concerns. Important policy concerns were then used to frame the assessment of pressures on ecosystems and estimate their condition.\nSome key results of this assessment include the unfavourable state of legally protected areas in Europe, the risk of pressures acting in synergy to worsen their impact and an overall decline in the ability of ecosystems to provide services, including timber, crop pollination, recreation and flood protection. This assessment further highlights the gaps in knowledge and the need for increased monitoring efforts in the region.\n\nFigure 3.

    "text": "Presentation\nWe organized this document to provide a preliminary context of this initiative and facilitate the communication among all partners. It will be updated regularly as we get more information and feedback. It will be also the basis of the final white paper.\n\n\nIntroduction\nThis initiative aims to improve knowledge and application of tools, approaches, and models that are appropriate at a Canadian scale for looking at how to address challenges such as conservation of biodiversity, carbon storage-services and traditional food security to support the establishment, active management and restoration of protected and conserved areas in the Hudson–James Bay Lowlands (HJBL).\nTools and approaches have been developed and applied in many countries and have been analyzed through several large processes (e.g., Methodological Assessment Report on Scenarios and Models of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES 2016)), yet their application has been limited in Canada. As Parks Canada develops new approaches for establishing new protected and conserved areas and enhances active management and restoration efforts to better address the dual crises of biodiversity conservation and climate change, there is a need to explore how to refine and apply these tools and models to ecosystems across Canada.\nIn this initiative, Parks Canada is asking the GEO BON international community WHAT frameworks, models and tools HAVE SUCCESSFULLY WORKED? in terms of informing decision making and policy to protect, manage and monitor biodiversity, ecosystem services (i.e., carbon storage) and traditional food security. Moreover, WHAT DOES NOT WORK and WHY?\n\n\nArea of interest\nThe Hudson-James Bay lowlands (HJBL) is located in the Mushkegowuk territory including various First nation communities: Attawapiskat First Nation, Taykwa Tagamou Nation, Kashechewan First Nation, Fort Albany First Nation, Moose Cree First Nation, Chapleau Cree First Nation, Missanabie Cree First Nation, and Weenusk First Nation (see Mushkegouk Council). It is located in northeast Canada, known also as the Hudson Bay Plains ecozone in the provinces on Ontario, Manitoba and Quebec.\nPeatlands are the dominat ecosystems in this region, providing multiple local and global ecosystems services as described by FAO-UN (2020): “Peatlands, also called”organic soils”, “bogs”, “fens”, “swamps” and “mires”, are the world’s most carbon-dense terrestrial ecosystems. Peatlands are formed from partially decomposed plant remains that have accumulated over thousands of years under conditions of waterlogging. Peat soils hold an estimated 650 billion tonnes (Gt = Pg) of carbon on only 3 percent of the Earth’s land surface – a carbon store that is equal in magnitude to the amount of carbon in the Earth’s vegetation, and more than half of the carbon in the atmosphere (Yu et al., 2010; Page et al., 2011; Dargie et al., 2017). Peatlands thus play a critical role in the global carbon cycle and in climate regulation. However, peatlands also deliver a range of other benefits for humanity, including water regulation, flood control, food, and cultural and livelihood opportunities. They support a diversity of habitats and unique and rare plant and animal species. The layers of accumulated peat contain an archive of information on changes in climate, vegetation and human activity since the last Ice Age” .\nThe interactive map below some important thematic layers:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelected features from these sources:\nCanada boundaries: open.canada.ca\nTreaties and territories: Native Land Digital\nEcozones (study area): National Ecological Framework\nProtected areas (raw data): World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA), downloading data using R interface wdpar.\n\n\nBackground\nIn 2021, Parks Canada Agency received funding for the Hudson–James Bay Lowlands Biodiversity Conservation and Sequestration Initiative. The goal of the Initiative is to work with a range of partners on studies regarding biodiversity conservation and the extent and quantity of carbon stocks and fluxes in wetland, peatland and coastal ecosystems in the Hudson–James Bay Lowlands (HJBL). This will advance understanding of:\na) ecological integrity of the Hudson-James Bay Lowlands;\nb) ecosystem carbon stocks dynamics (storage and sequestration);\nc) a full suite of other ecosystem services; and\nd) active management approaches to achieve biodiversity and carbon conservation co-benefits. In turn, these results will be used to develop approaches and practices to establish and effectively manage protected areas and Other Effective Conservation Measures (OECMs) on a landscape scale across Canada.\nTo situate and guide the work to be carried out in the HJBL with Indigenous and other partners, there is a need to compile and validate spatially-explicit and scale-appropriate tools and models appropriate for Canadian ecosystems.\nThere is also a need to consider how Traditional Knowledge can weave appropriately into these tools and models. One element of addressing this need, is to conduct a stocktaking and analysis of existing tools, approaches, and models that already exist, prior to developing or applying new ones.\n\n\nExpected results\n\nImproved knowledge of appropriate spatially-explicit, and scale-appropriate tools and models for biodiversity and carbon storage for the HJBL and other landscapes across Canada, including how these can support environmental reporting obligations. \nImproved understanding of frameworks and/or approaches that achieve biodiversity and carbon conservation co-benefits under different world views. \nImproved understanding of how to weave Traditional Knowledge systems into the application of identified tools and models.\n\n\n\nActivities\n\nPhase 1\n\nCompile and review relevant tools, approaches, and models developed in other countries and/or by other organizations.\n\n\n\nPhase 2\n\nCompile example case studies of application of relevant tools and approaches.\nConvene a workshop of federal, provincial/territorial, Indigenous, non-governmental, academic and international experts to explore appropriate tools and models for landscape across Canada. \nDevelop and deliver a discussion paper based on stocktaking exercise, case study analysis, and the outcome of the workshop with recommendations on appropriate tools and models, including the weaving of Traditional Knowledge into these that could be applied in the Hudson Bay-James Bay Lowlands and other landscapes across Canada.\n\n\n\nScope and expectations\nParks Canada is interested in compiling frameworks, methods, tools and case studies taking into account these criteria:\n\nEcosystem services: there are some preliminary priorities to explore within the wide range of ecological services :\n\nCarbon storage: HJBL harbor one of the most important peatland ecosystem in the world\nTraditional food security: there are some traditional food priorities for indigenous and local communities to explore: freshwater fisheries, wild foods.\n\nBiodiversity: explore different levels of biodiversity (from species to ecosystems)\nSpatially-explicit, and scale-appropriate models and tools\nIntegrate multiple knowledge systems\nExpectations\n\nsupport active management\nprotect species and landscapes\ndevelop good practices for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services management\nInform decision and policy makers\nIdentify actions that can be implemented now (tactical) and others in the future\n\n\nGEO BON is interested in developing a subnational BON, which is a network of scientists (international, national, regional), government agencies, Indigenous organizations and conservation groups working together to harmonize and integrate efforts to measure, assess and monitor biodiversity and ecosystem services. Parks Canada initiative in the Hudson-James Bay region is an excellent opportunity to start implementing the process for BON development, in particular the engagement phase.

    "text": "We summarized a preliminary review of frameworks that have been proposed to (i) protect and manage biodiversity and ecosystem; (ii) inform decision makers and (iii) guide global, national and regional policies to address biodiversity loss, prevent the erosion of ecosystem services, support sustainable use of natural resources, and integrate local communities and indigenous knowledge systems.\nMost of these frameworks overlap each other and also overlap with CBD goals, indicators and expected results. GEO BON framework, is an overarching framework aimed to measure, assess and monitor biodiversity and ecosystem services.\nFor instance, some global integrated assessment frameworks (FAO-UN, 2020) offer guidance to nations and other stakeholders for implementing programs to monitor and report on peatland’s state and management: Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), and The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. Other frameworks offer room to incorporate and evaluate some aspects of these ecosystems, for example: The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and Fire Monitoring Initiatives (e.g.,FireMARS Canada). However, spatially explicit assessment and impact evaluation is not fully supported and integrated by these frameworks.\nGEO BON is a framework to measure, monitor, assess and report all levels of biodiversity (genetic, populations, communities, species and ecosystems) and recently ecosystem services. It provides spatial explicit tools that can be applied at different spatial scales (from local to national and global). Integrating multiple knowledge system is also fundamental part of GEO BON development.\nIn the next sections, we start describing the GEO BON framework, followed by three sections: ecosystem services (, essential variables and indicators. Finally we present some multiple/dual frameworks attempting to prevent simultaneously overarching biodiversity threats, for instance biodiversity loss and climate change."

A comparison of the strengths, limitations, and best practices of each approach can be found in Table 1 which was reprinted from Schwantes et al. (in review). All three approaches rely on local site-specific field surveys for calibration and validation.\n\nStratify and MultiplyDirect Remote SensingMass balance models\n\n\nThe first approach, Stratify and Multiply, relies on first stratifying or partitioning the study area into multiple unique land cover or ecosystem types (Goetz et al. 2009, Sharp et al. 2020, Martínez-López et al. 2019). A reference or average carbon stock value is assigned to each cover type. The area of each cover type is then multiplied by the cover type’s associated reference carbon stock value.\nMany ecosystem service modeling platforms use a Stratify & Multiply approach, including the ARtificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services, ARIES (Martínez-López et al. 2019) and the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs, InVEST (Sharp et al. 2020). Best practices include using local site-specific field surveys to derive reference carbon stock values and detailed site-specific land cover maps that account for environmental gradients that might influence carbon stock changes (e.g., climate, soil characteristics, species composition, management, degradation, elevation, site history, wetland type, ecozone, etc.).\nCarbon emissions can be assessed in a similar way. For example, maps of peatland types can be combined with estimates of Net Ecosystem Exchange and Methane emission rates compiled for each peatland type and region (Webster et al. 2018).\n\n\nThe second approach, Direct Remote Sensing, uses a statistical or machine learning model to relate soil carbon field measurements to remotely sensed observations and other geospatial layers (Goetz et al. 2009, Sothe et al. 2021). The Direct Remote Sensing approach captures spatial variability of carbon within land cover classes, which is often missed with the Stratify and Multiply approach. Best practices include using local site-specific field surveys for model calibration and validation as well as local site-specific geospatial layers for covariates (e.g., topography, slope, soil type, wetland type, ecosystem type, soil characteristics, ecozone, etc.).\nCarbon stock maps can be differenced to track changes over time. Another new approach relies on multi-temporal Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) to estimate changes in peatland elevation after a wildfire (Reddy et al. 2015). Peatlands are becoming more susceptible to wildfires due to lowering water tables under climate change and development (Turetsky et al. 2015).\n\n\nThe third approach, Mass balance models, account for all key carbon pools and flows of carbon between these pools over time (GFOI, 2016, Bona et al. 2020). Mass balance models can track changes in carbon due to natural processes such as growth and decay as well as drivers of change including land use, wildfires, water table depth, and permafrost thaw.\nMass balance models are especially useful for understanding peatland carbon dynamics because they can account for the balance between the uptake of carbon and the emission of methane (Bona et al. 2020). Furthermore, these models can track changes in carbon due to increases in peatland disturbances, including droughts, permafrost thaw, and fires under climate change (Bona et al. 2020, Harris et al. 2022). When peatland permafrost thaws, previously frozen carbon can be decomposed, thereby releasing carbon dioxide and methane (Hugelius et al. 2020).\nMany modeling approaches have been implemented to estimate peatland carbon stocks in Canada including (1) the Canadian model for peatlands (CaMP) which accounts for wildfire disturbances but currently not permafrost thaw (Bona et al. 2020, although permafrost thaw is currently being implemented), (2) dynamic global ecosystem models that incorporate permafrost dynamics (Chaudhary et al. 2017), and (3) inventory-based models (Hugelius et al. 2020) that can also account for abrupt permafrost thaw (Turetsky et al. 2020). Best practices include integrating local site-specific field data for calibration and validation as well as remotely sensed data for accurate spatially explicit disturbance detection (e.g., Zhou et al. 2021, Bona et al. 2020, Shaw et al. 2021).\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

    "text": "in progress….\n\nIntroduction\nGlobally, a key source of food providing high quality protein and supporting healthy diets is fish (Béné et al., 2016). Subsistence fisheries are meant to provide enough food for the fisher and their family/community. These small- scale fisheries are essential to food security for many communities but also support the culture and sense of place of many indigenous peoples (McClanahan, Allison and Cinner, 2015). Typically, subsistence fisheries are more sustainable than large-scale commercial fishing but can be heavily impacted by these practices as they rely on the same stocks of fish (Béné et al., 2016). As such, many communities around the world are facing reduced catch as a consequence of declining stocks, threatening their food security and culture (Pauly, Watson and Alder, 2005).\n\nHow to measure itCase studiesMonitoringTools\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we discuss several case studies where issues of food security arose, from which lessons can be learnt for the HJBL region. All case studies discussed here involve indigenous communities relying on fish as a source of food but from different regions of the world: Alaska, Manitoba, Ontario, Nunavut, the Northwest Territories, Greenland and New Zealand.\nNew Zealand\nThe Māori, the indigenous people of New Zealand, make up 15% of the country’s population but 16% of them report being food insecure as opposed to 7% in the rest of the population (University of Otago and Ministry of Health, 2011). This difference has mainly been attributed to lower income of Māori households (Rashbrooke, 2013). Traditional food practices were replaced following colonization as access to traditional foods decreased and have been largely replaced by the international food system (McKerchar et al., 2015). Two solutions to these problems were identified during workshops done in collaboration with key stakeholders and from\npublished work led by Māori researchers:\n- Increase the availability of traditional foods in households by replenishing fish stocks and communal gardening projects.\n- Develop traditional food-based industries to generate income through employment opportunities.\nOne key element in increasing traditional food availabilities in New Zealand was the legal recognition of Māori rights to manage freshwater habitats, where tribes were able to challenge development legally, waters (and therefore food) were protected (The Waitangi Tribunal, 1984) but not where their property rights were not recognised (Memon and Kirk, 2011).\nAdditionally, local fishery areas of special importance to Māori people were given particular legal recognition, allowing tribes to engage more fully in management (Memon, Sheeran and Ririnui, 2003). However, establishing such areas remains challenging to do and the Minister of Fisheries maintains final decision-making power (Jackson, 2008). More effective at protecting fish species for traditional food are the legally protected reserves where commercial fishing is banned (Te Karaka, 2009).\nIn all, strengthening food security for Māori people has been helped through the settlement of historical grievances between the communities and the Crown that resulted in the return of legal rights and governance systems allowing them to play an active role in the management of resources. However, tensions between the government and Māori goals around resource management remain, especially around water rights and fisheries. Additionally, economic development such as dairy farming continues to pollute waterways and overfishing depletes fish stocks, threatening the traditional fisheries of the Māori.\nAlaska\nThe majority of Alaskan Natives now lives in urban centres, yet many small communities (10-600 people) still live in isolated areas that are often only accessible by boat or plane (Goldsmith, 2008). In these regions, people rely almost exclusively on a subsistence lifestyle largely reliant on wild caught fish (Goldsmith, 2008). However, people today rely on motorised boats that are expensive to maintain and fuel, creating a demand for cash that results in many working seasonally (or leaving for good) in urban centres to be able to afford to eat (Nuttall et al., 2004). Additionally, environmental change has resulted in dramatic ecological transitions, such as lakes drying up, and consequently significant declines in freshwater fish species (Schindler, 2001). These environmental changes can be sudden and unexpected, forcing people to adapt. Even though Alaskan Natives have a legally protected right to fish following their long held customs and traditions (Fall and Wolfe, 2012), state and federal law on wildlife management restricts people’s ability to adapt by imposing fishing seasons, quotas and area closures that are not informed by the changing reality on the ground (Loring and Gerlach, 2009). As a result, isolated communities are having to rely on long shelf-life foods from multinational corporations instead of traditional foods, affecting food security and health outcomes (Loring and Gerlach, 2009).\nTo cope with food insecurity, local communities have formed a network of cooperation based on cultural traditions, relationships and a mix of subsistence and cash economies (Kofinas et al., 2016). Strong social bonds between communities and households of Alaskan Natives and a culture of sharing mean that households that typically obtain more resources than others (food and cash) share food with others on a needs basis. However, even households with relatively more resources are often still food insecure and have at least one member in employment. This situation highlights differences at the household level with some households being more vulnerable to economic and climatic changes and an inability to fully achieve food security by the different communities without relying on a cash input from outside (Kofinas et al., 2016).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase study\nDescription\nActions taken\nImpact/results\n\n\n\n\nThe Māori, the indigenous people of New Zealand\nTraditional food practices were replaced following colonization as access to traditional foods decreased and have been largely replaced by the international food system (McKerchar et al., 2015)\n- Increase the availability of traditional foods in households by replenishing fish stocks and communal gardening projects.\n- Legal recognition of Māori rights to manage freshwater habitats\n- Develop traditional food-based industries to generate income through employment opportunities."

    "text": "Introduction\nin progress….\nFood security relates to the fundamental human right of access to food (United Nations, 1948). Specifically, food security is achieved when a reliable supply of food is available for a region/people (Mbow et al., 2019). In historically ostracised and remote communities, food security is a fundamental issue (Salomon et al., 2020). The impact of colonial practices on indigenous people around the world has resulted in many communities losing their food sovereignty and security (Whyte, 2018). In a time of reconciliation, efforts to revitalise traditional practices and return rights to indigenous people must address food security problems (Chuenpagdee and Jentoft, 2019).\nHere we present two main traditional food actitivities that are crucial for indigenous and local communities in the HJBL: freshwater fisheries and foraging wild foods.\nMany indigenous communities around the world face issues of food security, especially in remote areas. However, not all communities suffer from the same rates of food insecurity, even within similar ecological regions, for example about 25% of households in Western Alaska are food insecure compared to 69% in Nunavut (Chuenpagdee and Jentoft, 2019). In fact, Nunavut has the highest rate of food insecurity for any indigenous population living in a developed country (Council of Canadian Academies, 2014). Culture, history, local practices, environmental change, logistics and governance systems all play a role in food security outcomes. Figure 1 presents a conceptual framework for understanding the multiple contributors to food security in modern indigenous communities.\nFigure 1. presents a conceptual framework for understanding the multiple contributors to food security in modern indigenous communities.\n\nFigure 1. A conceptual representation of the multiple factors affecting food security in the Canadian North. “This dynamic, holistic, people-centred framework is a tool for analyzing and understanding food security and food sovereignty in northern Canada. The wheel represents the complex interplay between factors that affect northern Aboriginal peoples, and how food security and food sovereignty emerge from these relationships. Because the framework is fluid, no single factor should be interpreted as static or merely linked to the factor to which it is most closely positioned. Each factor is understood to have multiple relationships with other concepts within the wheel.” From Council of Canadian Academies, 2014."

This is a potetial framework that fits the most this initiative.\n\n\nAims/goals\nThis ais a preliminary list of aims and goals aimed to protect and manage biodiversity and ecosystem services. There is overlap in what local, national and global partners want to achieve. For instance:\n\nProtect species\nProtect ecosystems\nReduce extinction risk\nReduce habitat loss\nProvide sustained use of biodiversity\nProvide sustained use of ecosystem services\nMitigate/adapt climate change\n\n\n\nStrategies\nSeveral strategies can be combined to achieve multiple aims and goals listed above:\n\nProtect remaining and/or significant biodiversity areas\nMaintain genetically viable populations\nRe-introductions\nRestore habitats\nImprove habitat connectivity\n\n\n\nIndicators\nGEO BON offers a set of indicators that are developed based on essential variables (see next sections). For instance:\n\nProportion species with effective population size &gt; 500\nEcosystem extent\nTotal carbon stored\n\n\n\nApplications\nApplications in biodiversity conservation and management can be a product of multiple goals and strategies.\n\nConservation priorities\nManagement: biodiversity\nManagement: ecosystem services\nMonitoring: GEO BON provides a framework to monitor biodiversity and inform other applications and support decision makers and policy at different spatial scales (from local to national and global).\n\n\n\nExample\nThis is an example to illustrate the general framework, including the complexity of interrelationships of these elements. The overarching framework ‘Peoples and Natures’ implies multiple partners working in together in multiple aims/goals."
